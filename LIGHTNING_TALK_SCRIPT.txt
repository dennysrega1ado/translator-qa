## 🏗️ Architecture Overview (15 seconds - 5%)

"Quick architecture overview - we're running **three Docker containers**:"

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         INTERNET / USERS                │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                   │
        ┌──────────▼──────────┐
        │   Frontend (Nginx)  │  Port 80/3000
        │   HTML + JS + CSS   │
        └──────────┬──────────┘
                   │
        ┌──────────▼──────────┐
        │  Backend (FastAPI)  │  Port 8000
        │   Python + JWT      │
        └─────┬────────┬──────┘
              │        │
      ┌───────▼──┐  ┌──▼──────┐
      │PostgreSQL│  │ S3/MinIO│
      │   (DB)   │  │ (Files) │
      └──────────┘  └─────────┘
```

**Container roles:**
- **Frontend**: User interface served by Nginx
- **Backend**: FastAPI REST API with JWT authentication
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores users, translations, and manual scores
- **S3/MinIO**: Stores translation source files

"Everything is fully containerized with docker-compose for easy deployment."

## 📝 Review Process & Filters (3.5 minutes - 70%)

### Login & Navigation (20 seconds)

"Let me walk you through the review workflow. First, you **log in** with your credentials - we have admin and evaluator roles."

**Demo Steps:**
1. Show login screen
2. Enter credentials (admin/admin123)
3. Navigate to "Translations" view

### Execution Filter (25 seconds)

"The first thing you'll see is the **Execution Filter** dropdown. This is crucial because:"

- **Each execution** represents a batch of translations loaded from S3
- Example: "October 2025 - Haiku 3.5 with Glossary" or "November 2025 - naive DeepSeek R1"
- Select an execution to focus your review on specific translation batches
- You can also view "All Executions" to see everything

**Demo:** Select an execution from the dropdown

### Review Status Filters (30 seconds)

"Next, we have **three filter buttons** that are game-changers for productivity:"

1. **All** - Shows every translation in the selected execution
2. **Unreviewed** - Shows only translations you haven't scored yet (this is your work queue!)
3. **Reviewed** - Shows translations you've already completed

"The system automatically tracks your progress, so you can jump right back to where you left off."

**Demo:** Click through each filter to show how the count changes

### The Review Interface (50 seconds)

"Now let's look at the actual review interface. It's designed for efficient side-by-side comparison:"

**Left Column - Original (English):**
- Source text clearly displayed
- Gray header indicating "Source"

**Right Column - Translation (Spanish):**
- Translated text
- Blue header indicating "Target"

**Top Section - Quality Metrics:**
- **Overall LLM Score** prominently displayed (this is from automated evaluation)
- Individual metric cards showing:
  - Coherence score
  - Fidelity score
  - Naturalness score
- These are automated scores from our LLM evaluation pipeline

"These automated scores give you a baseline, but your manual review is the gold standard."

### Pagination & Search (35 seconds)

"Navigation is straightforward:"

- **Pagination info** shows "X of Y" total translations
- **Previous/Next buttons** let you move through translations sequentially
- **Search by ID** - if you need to find a specific translation, just paste the ID (shows first 8 characters: "245db4...")

"The system remembers which filter you're using, so navigation respects your current view."

**Demo:**
- Click Next a couple times
- Try searching for a specific ID
- Show how the counter updates

### Submitting a Review (40 seconds)

"Now the most important part - **actually reviewing a translation**:"

**Comments Section:**
- Optional text area for notes
- "Add any observations like: 'Great natural flow but formal tone might be too casual'"
- These comments are saved with your review

**Submit Button:**
- Big blue "Submit Review" button at the bottom
- Click to save your evaluation
- You'll see a **success animation** with a checkmark
- System automatically advances to the next unreviewed translation

**Demo:**
- Scroll to comments section
- Add a sample comment
- Click Submit Review
- Show success animation


### Filter + Pagination Power Move (20 seconds)

"Pro tip: Combine filters with pagination for maximum efficiency:"

1. Select your execution
2. Switch to "Unreviewed" filter
3. Work through them one by one with Next button
4. System auto-filters as you go

- Overall average
- "These are YOUR manual scores, not the automated ones"

**Export Functionality:**
- **Big "Export My Reviews" button** with download icon
- Generates Excel file with all YOUR reviews
- Includes translation IDs, scores, comments, timestamps
- Perfect for reporting or further analysis

**Demo:**
- Navigate to Summary tab
- Point out each section briefly
- Click Export button to show download

## 👨‍💼 Admin: Loading Translations & Data Persistence (15 seconds - 5%)

"Quick look at the **Admin tab** - this is how new translations get into the system:"

### Loading Process:

1. Navigate to "Load Translations from S3" section
2. **Validate Prefix** first - ensures the S3 path has the correct structure (en/ and es/ folders)
3. Enter a **description** (required!) - example: "October 2024 Marketing Batch"
4. Click **Load Translations** - loading overlay appears
5. System downloads JSONs, matches English-Spanish pairs, stores in PostgreSQL

### Data Persistence:

"All data lives in **PostgreSQL** - this means:"
- ✅ Translations persist even after container restarts
- ✅ Your manual scores are never lost
- ✅ Docker volume `postgres_data` ensures data survives
- ✅ Easy to backup with `pg_dump`

"For production, we recommend AWS RDS for even more reliability."

**Demo:**
- Show Admin panel
- Point to validation button
- Explain S3 prefix format briefly

## ☁️ AWS Production Deployment (30 seconds - 10%)

"Finally, let's talk about **going to production on AWS EC2**. Five key steps:"

### 5-Step Deployment Process:

**1. Create EC2 Instance**
   - Launch `t3.medium` instance (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
   - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - Attach Elastic IP (static public IP)
   - Configure Security Group: allow ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)
   - **Cost: ~$30/month**

**2. Install Docker Environment**
   - SSH into instance
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose
   - Verify with `docker --version`

**3. Configure IAM Role for S3**
   - Create IAM role with S3 read/write permissions
   - Attach role to EC2 instance
   - No need for AWS credentials in code - uses instance profile
   - Secure and AWS best practice

**4. Set Environment Variables**
   - Create `.env` file with:
     - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection)
     - `AWS_S3_BUCKET` (your bucket name)
     - `SECRET_KEY` (generate secure 32+ char key)
     - `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`
   - Update `docker-compose.yml` for production settings

**5. Deploy & Monitor**
   - Run `docker-compose up -d --build`
   - Access via `http://YOUR-ELASTIC-IP`
   - Set up automated backups with cron job
   - Monitor with `docker-compose logs -f`

### Cost Breakdown:
- EC2 t3.medium: $30/month
- EBS Storage 30GB: $2.40/month
- S3 Storage 50GB: $1.15/month
- **Total: ~$34/month**
