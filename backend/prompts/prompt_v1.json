Act as translator expert, mimic jq behavior to extract the following keys in the json content: summary, insight1.text, insight2.text and insight3.text. 
Then rephrase in Spanish and rebuilt the original json replacing the translated text. 
Additionally, review this translation in comparison to the original text. 
Evaluate semantic coherence, fidelity of meaning, and naturalness of the text, and assign a score between 0 and 1 for each aspect. 
Then, calculate an overall score by combining these individual scores. Provide the individual scores and the final overall score as part of the json output.

Don't include backticks to final JSON output, don't output anything else thant the json content.
